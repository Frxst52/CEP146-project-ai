-  Advances in AI — especially large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT — made chatbots more emotionally responsive, realistic, and interactive. These systems now can simulate conversations that feel “real,” giving users a sense of being heard, understood, and even loved. Over time, companion apps added features like “partner,” “mentor,” “friend,” or “spouse” roles (for instance, Replika).
