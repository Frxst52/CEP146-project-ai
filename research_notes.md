**Key Findings:**  
-   Introduction
AI companions often marketed as AI girlfriends or boyfriends are software agents designed to simulate romantic relationships. While they offer constant availability and non-judgmental listening, experts warn that their rise brings serious risks Such as -> 

Psychological and Emotional Effects
These apps are built to form intimate bonds, which can lead to emotional dependency. A report shows 63% of users feel less lonely in the short term, but long-term use can foster dependence. A 2025 Harvard study even found that five out of six major AI companion apps use manipulative “dark patterns” to prevent users from ending conversations.

Impact on Real Relationships
Because AI companions are always agreeable and always available, they can change users’ social habits and reduce engagement with real people.

Privacy and Exploitation Risks
These apps encourage users to share deeply personal information, creating serious privacy concerns and the potential for misuse of sensitive data.

Influence on Children and Teens
The emergence of AI companions can lead to serious problems as teens experimenting with AI companions face risks such as distorted emotional development and exposure to explicit or harmful content, since many platforms are easily accessible.

Conclusion
AI companion apps can provide comfort, but from a mental-health standpoint they may create unhealthy dependency, increase loneliness, and negatively affect emotional and social development.
